# CheesyProgram

The program is using the following prompt: <br>
A cheese container can hold 2.76 kg of cheese. 
Each evening, a fromager ships containers of cheese to a local grocery store. 
The cost of producing one container of cheese is $4.12, and the profit of each container of cheese is $1.45.

Write a program that does the following:

1) Prompts the user to enter the total amount of cheese produced each evening.
2) Outputs the number of containers needed to hold the cheese. (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)
3) Outputs the cost of producing the cheese.
4) Outputs the profit for producing cheese.

The following program uses I/O manipulators. The program also uses various header files to use string functions, math functions, and formatting functions. 

The assignment was to modify the pervious assignment's welcome prompt and upload it to Github.
